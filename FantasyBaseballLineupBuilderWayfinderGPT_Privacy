Privacy Policy for Fantasy Baseball Lineup Builder Wayfinder GPT & Custom Actions
Last updated: May 2025

This policy explains how your data is handled when you use the Fantasy Baseball Lineup Builder Wayfinder GPT, including its two custom actions: fetchGameOdds and fetchGameWeather.

1. Data Collection
User-Provided Inputs

Contest Files (CSV/XLSX): Player names, teams, salaries, etc.

Profile Quests & Preferences: Risk tolerance, weighting sliders, lineup feedback.

Commands & Prompts: Any messages you send to the Wayfinder.

Pinned Lineups & Ratings: Saved lineup data and your 1–5 ratings.

Custom Action Parameters

fetchGameOdds receives only a list of game identifiers (away_team, home_team, game_date).

fetchGameWeather receives only the city name of each home‐team venue.

2. Data Usage
All inputs are used solely to power lineup projections, visualizations, and gamification features.

Memory (preferences, pinned lineups) is stored to personalize future sessions; you can clear or overwrite these at any time.

No personal identifiers (IP address, email) are collected or stored by this Wayfinder.

3. Third-Party API Integrations
When you trigger:

fetchGameOdds → Data is sent to the-odds-api.com

Sent: sport_key, list of teams, date parameters, and your API key.

Received: Odds JSON (spreads, totals, moneylines).

fetchGameWeather → Data is sent to yahoo-weather5.p.rapidapi.com

Sent: location (city name), format=json, u=f, plus RapidAPI host & key headers.

Received: Weather JSON (current conditions, 10-day forecast).

Your API keys are passed only as query or header parameters; they are not logged or stored by the Wayfinder beyond the duration of the immediate call.

4. Data Storage & Retention
Session Data: All conversation and lineup data persist only for the active ChatGPT session.

Memory (user preferences, pinned lineups) is stored per OpenAI’s memory feature and can be reviewed or deleted.

No Long-Term Storage: We do not save your contest files, lineups, or API responses on any external server.

5. Security
All communications to The Odds API and Yahoo Weather API occur over HTTPS with your API keys.

We do not expose or share your API keys with any third party beyond the service hosts.

You remain in control of revoking or rotating your API keys at any time via your provider dashboards.

6. Your Choices & Control
Clear Memory: Ask the Wayfinder to forget your preferences or pinned lineups.

Opt-Out: You may choose not to use any feature that requires external API calls.

Data Access: Within ChatGPT, you can request a summary of what memory entries exist.

7. Compliance
We process only the minimal data necessary to fulfill your requests.

We comply with applicable privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR, CCPA) by allowing you to access, correct, or delete your stored memory.

No data is sold or used for advertising purposes.
