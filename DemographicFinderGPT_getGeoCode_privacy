Privacy Policy for the getGeoCode Custom Action

Last updated: May 7, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the getGeoCode custom action (“Action”) used within ChatGPT (“Service”) collects, uses, retains, and shares personal information when you request geocoding of a street address.

1. Information We Collect
User-Provided Data:
• Full street address (including city, state, and ZIP) that you submit to the Action.

Technical Metadata:
• IP address of the Service at the time of the API call (collected by the RapidAPI gateway).
• Timestamps and API usage metrics (e.g. number of requests, response times).

2. How We Use Your Information
Primary Purpose:
We forward your submitted address to the Google Maps Geocoding API solely to obtain latitude and longitude coordinates.

Service Improvement:
Aggregated, de-identified usage data (e.g., request volumes, error rates) may be analyzed to monitor and improve the reliability and performance of the Action.

3. Data Retention
User-Provided Address:
Not stored by the Action or by OpenAI. Each address is forwarded live to the geocoding provider and then discarded.

Technical Metadata:
Retained by RapidAPI for up to 90 days for operational monitoring and auditing, after which it is automatically purged.

4. Data Sharing and Disclosure
With Geocoding Provider:
Your address is transmitted to Google Maps Geocoding API (via RapidAPI). Google processes the address solely for geocoding and is bound by its own privacy policy.

No Other Third-Party Sharing:
We do not sell or share your address or results with any other third parties.

5. Security
All requests to the Action are made over HTTPS (TLS 1.2+).

API keys are stored encrypted and never embedded in client-side code.

Access to logs and infrastructure is restricted to authorized personnel only.

6. Your Rights
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:

Access or obtain a copy of the personal data we hold (e.g., logs containing your address).

Rectify inaccurate or incomplete data.

Delete or request erasure of personal data.

Restrict or object to particular processing activities.

Withdraw Consent to future geocoding requests at any time by discontinuing use of the Action.

7. Compliance
GDPR: We comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation for users in the European Economic Area.

CCPA: California residents have rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act.

8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy to reflect changes in practices or legal requirements. We will notify you by updating the “Last updated” date above.
