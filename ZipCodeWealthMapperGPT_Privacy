Privacy Policy for ZipCode Wealth Mapper GPT Custom Action

Last updated: June 22, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the ZipCode Wealth Mapper GPT custom action (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you invoke the getWealthDataByZip endpoint via OpenAI ChatGPT.

1. Information We Collect
Query Parameters

ZIP code (e.g. “90210”)

Year (always “2022”)

These are the only user-supplied inputs forwarded to the IRS RapidAPI endpoint.

Response Data

Aggregated, anonymized IRS statistics at the ZIP code level (e.g. number of returns, AGI totals, filing-status breakdowns, income brackets, credits, deductions, etc.).

No personally identifying information (PII) or individual taxpayer records are ever requested or stored—only public, aggregated ZIP-level data.

Chat Context

The conversation context you provide to ChatGPT (prompt history) may be logged by OpenAI per its standard usage policies. We do not separately retain or log it.

2. How We Use Your Information
To Fulfill Data Requests
We forward your ZIP and year parameters to the IRS RapidAPI service to retrieve aggregated tax data, and then return that data to you within the ChatGPT session.

Operational Analytics & Improvement
We may collect anonymous usage metrics (number of requests, error rates) solely to monitor performance, diagnose issues, and improve reliability. These metrics do not include any PII.

3. Data Sharing and Third Parties
IRS RapidAPI Service
We transmit your ZIP and year parameters to irs-individual-income-tax-statistics.p.rapidapi.com under your API key. They return only aggregated data.

OpenAI
All inputs and outputs are processed by the ChatGPT platform and are subject to OpenAI’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

No Other Disclosures
We do not sell, rent, or otherwise share any inputs or outputs with unaffiliated third parties.

4. Data Retention
On Our Side
We do not persistently store any of your query parameters or the returned IRS data beyond the lifespan of the ChatGPT session.

On the IRS RapidAPI Side
Usage may be subject to RapidAPI’s own logging and retention practices. Please review RapidAPI’s Privacy Policy for details.

On OpenAI’s Side
Chat history and API interactions are retained per OpenAI’s retention policies. See OpenAI’s Privacy Policy for specifics.

5. Security Measures
We require an API key (X-Rapidapi-Key) for all requests; keys are managed by you and never exposed in responses.

All data transmissions occur over HTTPS to ensure encryption in transit.

We do not store any API keys or sensitive data on our servers.

6. Compliance and User Rights
Anonymity
No PII is collected or stored—only public, aggregate statistics.

Data Accuracy
We rely on IRS data provided via RapidAPI; we do not modify or interpret raw values beyond formatting for display.

Your Choices

You control which ZIP codes you query.

You may delete your ChatGPT conversation at any time via the OpenAI interface.

Policy Updates
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in practices or legal requirements. A “Last updated” date will always appear at the top.
