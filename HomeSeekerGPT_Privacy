Privacy Policy for HomeSeeker GPT Custom Action

Last updated: May 3, 2025

1. Introduction
HomeSeeker GPT (“we,” “us,” “our”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and disclose information when you invoke the custom action findHomesByCriteria in ChatGPT.

2. Information We Collect

Price range (minPrice, maxPrice)

Beds and baths preferences

Property type

Usage Metadata

Timestamp of each API call

Request identifiers for troubleshooting

3. How We Use Your Information

To query the Zillow-powered API and return matching home listings.

To monitor saved buyer profiles and notify you of new or changed listings.

To improve the accuracy and performance of our custom action over time.

4. Data Sharing & Third-Party Services

All real estate data requests are forwarded to Zillow’s API via RapidAPI. We do not share your personal parameters (e.g. location, price range) with any party besides this API.

RapidAPI and Zillow’s API providers may process request metadata in accordance with their own privacy policies.

We will never sell, rent, or otherwise transfer your personal data to unrelated third parties.

5. API Credentials

Your RapidAPI key is stored securely by OpenAI’s Custom Actions framework. It is never exposed to other users, nor returned in any API response.

We do not see or log your API key; it is managed entirely within OpenAI’s system.

6. Data Retention

Parameter values (quiz answers and filters) stored via our createBuyerProfile action are retained only in ChatGPT’s memory for the duration of your session or until you delete them.

We do not retain historical search results or personal profiles beyond what you explicitly instruct us to save.

7. Security

All data in transit is encrypted via HTTPS.

OpenAI’s infrastructure complies with industry-standard security controls to protect your information.

8. Your Rights

Access & Correction: You can request retrieval or correction of any buyer profile data stored in ChatGPT memory at any time.

Deletion: You can delete your saved profile by asking the assistant to “clear my buyer profile.”

Opt-Out: You may opt out of monitoring alerts by disabling the monitorProfile custom action or deleting your buyer profile.

9. Children’s Privacy
HomeSeeker GPT is not intended for use by children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from minors.

10. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or regulations. We will post the revised date above when any material changes occur.
