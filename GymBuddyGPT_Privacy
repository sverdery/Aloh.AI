When you interact with GymBuddy GPT, the following data may be temporarily processed:

No personally identifiable information (PII) beyond your stored fitness profile preferences is shared with the ExerciseDB API. Your data is strictly used to provide personalized and accurate responses to your workout-related queries.

Data Not Collected or Stored

We do NOT:

Permanently store personal identifiers (e.g., full names, addresses, email addresses).

Share your profile or interaction data externally beyond ExerciseDB API requests.

Sell, lease, or distribute any collected data to third parties for marketing or any other unrelated purposes.

Data Security and Retention

All API requests made by GymBuddy GPT are securely transmitted over HTTPS.

Interaction data temporarily cached for improving user experience is routinely purged and securely deleted when no longer required.

Compliance and Disclosure

GymBuddy GPT complies with applicable privacy laws and ChatGPT’s strict security guidelines.

We will not disclose data to third parties unless required by law or as necessary to provide the service (e.g., ExerciseDB API via RapidAPI).
