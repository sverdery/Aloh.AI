1. What Data We Collect
1.1. User-Provided Inputs
Contract Text & Uploaded Documents
When you paste or upload contract text (plain text, .docx, or .pdf), we process that entire text in memory to analyze, flag clauses, and generate summaries.

Legal Questions & Context
Any natural-language question you ask (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat makes a contract legally binding?‚Äù), including any additional metadata you provide (jurisdiction code, language preference, user role).

User Role/Context Option
If you specify your role (e.g., Freelancer, Startup, Paralegal), that descriptor is processed to tailor tone and recommendations.

Optional Clause Comparison Data
When you upload or paste a ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù clause for similarity checking, we process both texts temporarily for analysis.

1.2. Metadata & Technical Data
API Call Metadata
Each time we invoke the AI Lawyer Online Legal Advice API (via RapidAPI), we transmit the minimal required headers (X-Rapidapi-Key, X-Rapidapi-Host) and your JSON payload containing ‚Äúmessage,‚Äù ‚Äúspecialization,‚Äù ‚Äúlanguage,‚Äù and ‚Äújurisdiction.‚Äù

System Logs (OpenAI Platform)
OpenAI may log usage metrics (timestamps, request-IDs, model responses) to ensure service integrity, debugging, and platform monitoring.

Session Context
Temporary session context (conversation history) is retained in memory only during an active session to maintain conversational continuity. ChatGPT resets context when sessions end.

2. How We Use and Share Data
2.1. Data Processing & Purpose
Contract Analysis & Summaries
We process user-provided contract text solely to:

Flag ‚Äúred-flag‚Äù clauses and risk levels (üî¥, üü°, üü¢)

Generate plain-English summaries and suggested revisions

Provide interactive workflows (ToC, checklists, decision trees)

Legal Research & Q&A
When you ask a contract-law question, we forward your question to the AI Lawyer API. The API returns a text response and any included citations; we display that back to you.

Improvement & Debugging
Aggregate, anonymized usage metrics (no personally identifiable information or raw text) may be logged by OpenAI for model performance analysis, debugging, and feature enhancements. These logs do not contain your full contract text or specific question contents.

2.2. Data Sharing
With AI Lawyer API (RapidAPI)
Any question you ask under ‚ÄúLegal Research & Q&A‚Äù is forwarded (with your jurisdiction and specialization) to RapidAPI‚Äôs ‚ÄúAI Lawyer Online Legal Advice‚Äù endpoint. RapidAPI processes your query to generate a response.

With OpenAI
Under OpenAI‚Äôs Data Usage Terms, input text may be used to train and improve underlying models unless you have an Enterprise or Data-Control plan that opts out. If you require that none of your inputs be used for model training, please contact us or ensure your OpenAI plan prohibits such sharing.

No Other Third-Party Sharing
We do not sell, rent, or share your raw contract text, questions, or session transcripts with any other third parties (law firms, advertisers, data brokers) unless explicitly authorized by you or required by law.

3. Third-Party Data Handling (RapidAPI/AI Lawyer API)
When we call the AI Lawyer API:

Your Query Transmission

We transmit your JSON payload (message, specialization: "contract", language: "en", jurisdiction) over HTTPS to RapidAPI.

We include your API key only in the X-Rapidapi-Key header.

RapidAPI‚Äôs Role

RapidAPI routes this request to the ‚ÄúAI Lawyer Online Legal Advice‚Äù service provider.

RapidAPI and the underlying service provider may log your request and their response for usage tracking, billing, and performance monitoring under their respective Privacy Policies.

Response Handling

The API‚Äôs JSON response (fields like answer and optional citation) is returned to us, and we display it to you.

No Continued Storage by Us

We do not retain copies of the RapidAPI response (beyond your current session). Once the session ends, that response is purged from memory.

Note: We strongly encourage you to review RapidAPI‚Äôs privacy policy and the specific ‚ÄúAI Lawyer Online Legal Advice‚Äù service‚Äôs terms to understand how they process and retain data.

4. Data Retention and Security Measures
4.1. Retention
Active Session Data

Contract text, chat history, and user questions are held in memory only during your active session.

When a session expires or you close the chat, all raw text is purged.

Audit Logs & Anonymized Metrics

OpenAI may store anonymized logs for up to 30 days (or longer, per OpenAI policy) for abuse detection and system reliability. These logs do not contain personally identifiable details or raw user content beyond what‚Äôs needed for troubleshooting.

No proprietary contract language is stored in persistent logs unless required for billing or compliance, in which case it is redacted or anonymized.

4.2. Security Controls
Encryption In Transit

All data between you and OpenAI‚Äôs servers (including third-party API calls) is encrypted via HTTPS/TLS.

Access Controls

Only authorized service components can decrypt data in transit.

Personnel do not have direct access to session-specific contract text.

Data Isolation

Each user session is logically isolated from others.

RapidAPI calls use your personal API key (if provided) or a shared business key, ensuring separation of queries.

Regular Security Audits

We adhere to OpenAI‚Äôs security best practices and RapidAPI‚Äôs requirements.

Periodic reviews of data handling, key rotation procedures, and vulnerability scans are conducted.

5. User Controls & Rights
5.1. Access and Correction
Because we do not permanently store your raw contract text or personal data, we generally cannot retrieve or edit data from past sessions.

If you believe your information was logged improperly, contact us immediately (see Contact Information below) so we can investigate and, if necessary, delete any retained traces.

5.2. Opt-Out of Training
If you do not want your inputs (queries, contract text) used to improve or train underlying AI models:

Verify your OpenAI account settings under Data Controls (if on a paid plan).

Contact us to request that your session data be excluded from any future model-training sets.

5.3. Deletion Requests
We do not store identifying personal data long-term. Thus, upon session termination, your contract text is deleted.

If you want confirmation of deletion or have additional data rights requests (e.g., if your organization‚Äôs policy requires a signed Data Processing Agreement), please reach out to our Privacy Officer (see Contact Information below).

5.4. Children‚Äôs Privacy
The Service is not intended for children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any personal data to Paralegal CoPilot.

6. Legal Disclosures & Compliance
6.1. No Legal Advice
Paralegal CoPilot GPT is an informational tool. Its analyses and suggestions are not legal advice.

Always consult a licensed attorney before making any binding decisions or taking legal action.

6.2. Jurisdictional Boundaries
The ‚ÄúLegal Research & Q&A‚Äù task relies on the AI Lawyer API, which is trained on general legal principles as of mid-2024.

Laws differ by jurisdiction, and statutes/case references may have changed since the AI‚Äôs knowledge cutoff.

We explicitly disclaim liability for accuracy or currency of legal information provided.

6.3. Compliance with Data Protection Laws
We comply with applicable data protection regulations, including GDPR, CCPA, and any other local privacy laws.

If you reside in the EU/UK or California and believe your rights under GDPR/CCPA have been violated, please refer to Section 5 for contact and deletion requests.

6.4. Lawful Requests
We may disclose data if required by a valid court order, subpoena, or other legal process.

In that event, we will notify you promptly (unless prohibited by law) so you can contest the request.

7. Updates to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in:

Applicable laws or regulations

OpenAI or RapidAPI data-handling practices

New features or architectural changes to Paralegal CoPilot GPT

When we make significant updates, we will revise the ‚ÄúLast updated‚Äù date at the top. Reasonable notice (via platform notification or email, if provided) will be given before changes take effect.
