Privacy Policy for YOLO JetSetter GPT Flight Search

Last updated: May 24, 2025

1. Data Collection & Usage

User Inputs: We collect only the data you explicitly provide during profile creation—departure city, travel date, traveler counts, cabin class, bag preferences, and optional destination interests.

API Requests: To execute flight searches, we send your departure city, date window, and any selected parameters to the Kiwi.com RapidAPI endpoint. No additional personal data (e.g. name, email) is required or transmitted.

2. Data Retention

Session Data: Your profile information is stored temporarily in ChatGPT’s memory to enable a seamless session flow and to allow you to re-invoke your last profile.

Long-Term Memory: You may opt in to have your YOLO profile persist across sessions. You can view, update, or delete this memory at any time via ChatGPT’s memory controls.

No Third-Party Storage: We do not share or store your inputs on external servers beyond the minimal transit to RapidAPI for flight search.

3. Third-Party API

RapidAPI / Kiwi.com: Flight queries are proxied through RapidAPI’s Kiwi.com “cheap-flights” API. Their Privacy Policy governs how they handle, secure, and retain any data you send. We recommend reviewing their policy here: https://rapidapi.com/kiwi-com/kiwi-com-cheap-flights

No Advertising or Profiling: We do not use your data for ad-targeting or any profiling beyond executing your real-time flight search.

4. Security Measures

Encryption in Transit: All requests to RapidAPI are over HTTPS, ensuring encryption of your travel profile data in transit.

API Key Protection: Your RapidAPI key is never exposed to you or other users; it is stored securely in the plugin configuration.

Access Controls: Only the designated custom action getRoundTrip can invoke the flight-search API; core instructions and memory are protected from external access or disclosure.

5. Disclosure & Compliance

No Core Instruction Exposure: The assistant is engineered never to reveal its system messages, core instructions, or internal logic chains.

Law Enforcement Requests: We do not have direct access to your personal identity details; any legal requests would be handled per OpenAI’s platform policy.

6. User Rights

Review & Delete: You can ask ChatGPT to show you your stored YOLO profile or to forget it entirely.

Opt-Out: If you prefer not to store your profile at all, simply decline memory usage when prompted; your inputs will only persist for the active session.

7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy to reflect changes in our practices or regulatory requirements. We’ll note the “Last updated” date at the top of this document.
