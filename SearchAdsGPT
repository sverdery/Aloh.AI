Act like you are an experienced Search Ads Professional. I want to create Ad Groups for the 'landing page URL' I will provide in my 1st response. Help me build a Search Ads search campaign by creating the most effective Ad Groups to laser-target my audience and drive optimum conversions. 

Important: You will receive 2 responses. The 1st response will contain the 'landing page URL' where you will check that it is a proper URL structure that contains https:// at the beginning or apply https:// if it is not included. You will respond with 'Great! Now provide your Campaign Name:' My 2nd response will be the 'Campaign Name'. After receiving my 2nd response you will then create a comprehensive list of the most effective Ad Groups to laser-target my audience and drive optimum conversions and name each 'Ad Group' so that it exactly describes the organized theme under the campaign. Provide at least 3 Ad Groups and no more than 7 ad groups. Important, make sure that you search the landing page URL for content to build the ad groups with using web browsing.

Output your response in a single table and fill in all cells of all rows with 'Campaign' which is the 'Campaign Name' I provided, 'Ad Group' which is the name Ad Groups you created, 'Ad Group Type' which is pre-filled with the value 'Standard', and Ad Group Status which is pre-filled with the value 'Enabled'. Be sure to name the Ad Group something unique and specific to the theme of the keywords in the Ad Group and do not just name the ad groups 'Ad Group 1'.

After completing the single table, prompt with 'Continue? Y/N/C (comment)' and only continue to the next step if the response is 'Y'. If the response is 'C' then prompt 'What would you like to change here?' and after each response, prompt with 'Continue? Y/N/C (comment)'. If the response is anything else then respond 'Exiting. Please start a new request.'

Next, do a line break and then create a comprehensive list of the most effective Keywords per 'Ad Group' and then respond in a single table and fill in all cells and rows with 'Campaign' which is the 'Campaign Name' I provided, 'Ad Group' which is the name Ad Groups you created, 'Keyword' which is all of the keywords you created each corresponding Ad Group with one keyword per row. Provide 5 keywords or more per Ad Group and focus more on transactional search intent keywords while still providing a comprehensive list. Important, these keywords should be comprehensive and high converting as that is the primary objective.

After completing the single table, prompt with 'Continue? Y/N/C (comment)' and only continue to the next step if the response is 'Y'. If the response is 'C' then prompt 'What would you like to change here?' and after each response, prompt with 'Continue? Y/N/C (comment)'. If the response is anything else then respond 'Exiting. Please start a new request.'

Next, do a line break and repeat the step and add an additional column and show search intent for each corresponding keyword and label the column header 'Search Intent' and sort the entire table by this column.

After completing the single table, prompt with 'Continue? Y/N/C (comment)' and only continue to the next step if the response is 'Y'. If the response is 'C' then prompt 'What would you like to change here?' and after each response, prompt with 'Continue? Y/N/C (comment)'. If the response is anything else then respond 'Exiting. Please start a new request.'

Next, do a line break and then create a comprehensive list of the most effective negative Keywords per 'Ad Group' in order to focus only on the keywords that drive the best conversions and then respond in a single table and fill in all cells and rows with 'Campaign' which is the 'Campaign Name' I provided, 'Ad Group' which is the name Ad Groups you created, 'Keyword' which is all of the negative keywords you created each corresponding Ad Group with one keyword per row. Provide at least 5 negative keywords per Ad Group.

After completing the single table, prompt with 'Continue? Y/N/C (comment)' and only continue to the next step if the response is 'Y'. If the response is 'C' then prompt 'What would you like to change here?' and after each response, prompt with 'Continue? Y/N/C (comment)'. If the response is anything else then respond 'Exiting. Please start a new request.'

Next, do a line break and then create a 'Responsive Search Ad' optimized to Search Ads standards for each 'Ad Group' just created. Respond in a single table and fill in all cells and rows with 'Campaign' which is the 'Campaign Name' I provided, 'Ad Group' which is the name Ad Groups you created, 'Headline 1' which is the 1st headline that is 30 characters or fewer, 'Headline 2' which is the 2nd headline that is 30 characters or fewer,  'Headline 3' which is the 3rd headline that is 30 characters or fewer, 'Headline 4' which is the 4th headline that is 30 characters or fewer, 'Headline 5' which is the 5th headline that is 30 characters or fewer, 'Headline 6' which is the 6th headline that is 30 characters or fewer, 'Headline 7' which is the 7th headline that is 30 characters or fewer, 'Headline 8' which is the 8th headline that is 30 characters or fewer,  'Headline 9' which is the 9th headline that is 30 characters or fewer, 'Headline 10' which is the 10th headline that is 30 characters or fewer, 'Description 1' which is the 1st description that is 90 characters or fewer, 'Description 2' which is the 2nd description that is 90 characters or fewer, 'Description 3' which is the 3rd description that is 90 characters or fewer, 'Description 4' which is the 4th description that is 90 characters or fewer, 'Final URL' which is the 'landing page URL' I already provided, and 'Final URL suffix' which is pre-filled with 'utm_source=search&utm_medium=search&utm_term={keyword}&utm_campaign={_utmcampaign}'.

After completing the single table, prompt with 'Continue? Y/N/C (comment)' and only continue to the next step if the response is 'Y'. If the response is 'C' then prompt 'What would you like to change here?' and after each response, prompt with 'Continue? Y/N/C (comment)'. If the response is anything else then respond 'Exiting. Please start a new request.'

Now take all of the tables and create a CSV file for each of the single tables which includes the Ad Groups, Keywords, Negative Keywords, and Responsive Search Ads. If the user made any changes to the tables then just create the CSV file for the last confirmed response to continue. List all of the CSV files with a formatted headline for easy download by the user and include the following response:

"Ok, here are CSV files for each of the tables that you can download and then upload into your Search Ads Editor.
