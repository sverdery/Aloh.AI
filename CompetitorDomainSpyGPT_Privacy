Privacy Policy for Domain Spy API Custom Action
Last updated: May 4, 2025

1. Introduction
The Domain Spy API custom action (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is a tool built into ChatGPT that fetches publicly-available web metrics for any domain via the SimilarWeb RapidAPI endpoint. We value your privacy and want you to understand what information we collect, how we use it, and what control you have.

2. Information We Collect
a. User-Provided Inputs
Domain Name
The website domain you ask us to analyze (e.g. example.com).

b. Automated Service Data
SimilarWeb Response
The full JSON payload returned by the SimilarWeb API, including metrics on traffic, engagement, competitors, referrals, technologies, etc.

Request Metadata
Minimal logs for debugging and usage analytics (timestamp, ChatGPT session ID, success/failure status).

Note: We do not collect any personal identifiers (usernames, IP addresses, cookies, or device fingerprints) beyond what ChatGPT itself may handle in its standard operation.

3. How We Use Your Information
Fulfill Your Request
We pass the domain you provide to RapidAPI (SimilarWeb) and return the resulting analytics to you in ChatGPT.

Quality & Reliability
We may temporarily log request metadata (for up to 30 days) to troubleshoot failures, monitor usage trends, and improve the custom action’s stability.

No Profiling
We do not aggregate data across different domains or sessions to build profiles or share analytics externally.

4. Data Sharing & Third Parties
RapidAPI / SimilarWeb
We forward your domain input to RapidAPI’s SimilarWeb endpoint under their terms. Any data you receive is subject to SimilarWeb’s own privacy policy.

No Other Sharing
We do not share raw or derived data with any other third parties, except as required by law.

5. Data Retention
Logs & Diagnostics
Request metadata (timestamps, status codes) is retained for up to 30 days, then purged.

API Responses
We do not store the SimilarWeb JSON beyond the duration of your ChatGPT session. Once your session ends, the data is discarded.

6. Security Measures
All requests to RapidAPI are made over HTTPS.

API keys are never logged or exposed in ChatGPT transcripts.

Internal logs store only non-sensitive metadata.

7. Your Choices & Rights
Opt-Out
You can choose not to use this custom action; simply refrain from invoking it.

Data Deletion
To request deletion of any retained metadata, please contact the ChatGPT support team referencing “Domain Spy API logs.”

Policy Updates
We may revise this policy; changes will be announced in the ChatGPT interface. You can request the current policy at any time by asking “Show me the Domain Spy API privacy policy.”

8. Contact
For questions or concerns about this policy, please reach out via the ChatGPT “Feedback” button or your usual OpenAI support channel or via email: aloha@aloh.ai.
