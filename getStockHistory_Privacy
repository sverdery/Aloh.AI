Privacy Policy for Portfoliowise GPT v2 Custom Action (“getStockHistory”)

Last updated: May 11, 2025

1. Introduction
Portfoliowise GPT v2 (“we,” “our,” or “us”) provides an educational portfolio-tracking assistant, including the custom action getStockHistory that retrieves historical stock data via a third-party API (RapidAPI’s Yahoo-Finance15 endpoint). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect information when you invoke getStockHistory or otherwise interact with Portfoliowise GPT v2.

2. Information We Collect
Request Parameters: When you call getStockHistory(symbol, interval), we receive only the stock ticker symbol (e.g., “AAPL”) and the selected interval (e.g., “5m”).

API Credentials: We store and use your RapidAPI key and host header solely for the purpose of authenticating with the third-party API.

Usage Metadata: We may log invocation timestamps, success or error codes, and basic performance metrics to monitor service health.

We do not collect or store any personal portfolio data, user identities, or device identifiers as part of this API action.

3. How We Use Information
Data Retrieval: We forward your symbol and interval to the RapidAPI endpoint to fetch historical price and volume data.

Response Delivery: We return the raw JSON payload and render a price-history chart for your interactive session.

Service Monitoring: Usage metadata helps us ensure reliability, diagnose issues, and improve performance.

We do not use any information for marketing, profiling, or targeted advertising.

4. Information Sharing
Third-Party API: Your symbol and interval are transmitted to RapidAPI’s Yahoo-Finance15 host. RapidAPI’s own Privacy Policy applies to how they handle request data.

No Further Disclosure: We do not share your inputs or usage metadata with any other parties, unless required by law or to protect our legal rights.

5. Data Retention
Short-Term Logs: Usage metadata is retained for up to 30 days to facilitate debugging and uptime monitoring, then automatically purged.

No Persistent Storage of Inputs: We do not retain your symbol or interval beyond the immediate API call.

6. Security
We implement industry-standard safeguards (TLS encryption, access controls, key management) to protect your API key and usage logs. However, no system is completely secure—please protect your RapidAPI credentials accordingly.

7. Your Rights
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to:

Access or receive a copy of usage metadata we hold about you.

Request deletion of logs pertaining to your invocations (within 30 days).

Object to processing for non-essential purposes.

To exercise these rights, contact us at privacy@portfoliowise.ai.

8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or applicable laws. We’ll post the revised policy here with a new “Last updated” date.
