Privacy Policy for Sentiment Analysis Custom Action

Last updated: May 13, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how the “AdInsights Analyzer Wayfinder GPT” (“we,” “our,” or “us”) handles any text you provide when invoking the getSentiment custom action, which uses the Twinword Sentiment Analysis API via RapidAPI. By using this feature, you agree to the collection, use, and disclosure of your data as described below.

1. Data Collection
User-Provided Text: When you request sentiment analysis, any ad copy text you upload or paste into the chat is sent to the Twinword API endpoint for processing.

Metadata: We may collect minimal metadata necessary to route your request (e.g., request timestamp).

2. Purpose of Data Use
Functionality Only: Your text is used solely for real-time sentiment analysis. We do not use it for any other purpose (marketing, profiling, training models, etc.).

No Persistent Storage: We do not store your text or analysis results beyond the immediate session, except for a concise summary saved in your ChatGPT memory (as part of the agreed continuous-memory feature) for your own future reference.

3. Third-Party Processing
Twinword API: Your text is transmitted to Twinword via the RapidAPI marketplace. Processing and any temporary storage are governed by Twinword’s and RapidAPI’s own privacy policies, not ours.

No Additional Sharing: We do not share your text or analysis results with any other third parties.

4. Security Measures
Encrypted Transport: All requests to Twinword’s API are made over HTTPS.

API Key Protection: Your RapidAPI key is used only as an authentication header and is never shared or exposed in the chat interface.

5. Data Retention & Deletion
Session Data: All raw ad copy you provide is discarded immediately after the sentiment response is delivered.

Memory Summaries: Condensed summaries (e.g., “Ad Copy A: Positive sentiment”) are stored in your ChatGPT memory per your request, so you can recall past insights. You can clear or disable memory at any time via ChatGPT’s settings.

6. Your Responsibilities
Content Ownership: Ensure you have the right to submit any text you provide. Do not submit sensitive personal data, health information, or other regulated content.

Policy Compliance: You remain responsible for compliance with applicable laws and for obtaining any necessary consents from individuals whose data may be included in your ad copy.

7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. The “Last updated” date will indicate when any changes were made.
