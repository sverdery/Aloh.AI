# Privacy Policy for Ad Creative Comparator Custom Actions

**Last Updated:** 2025-06-06

## 1. Introduction  
This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect any data when you call our two image-analysis custom actions (colorDetectionAPI and objectRecognitionAPI) through Ad Creative Comparator GPT. These actions rely on third-party image-analysis APIs accessed via RapidAPI.

## 2. Data Collection & Use  
- **colorDetectionAPI Endpoint**  
  - **Data Received:**  
    - `image_url` (public URL of the banner-ad image to analyze)  
  - **Purpose:** Extract the dominant color(s) from the provided image for use as `button_color`.  
  - **Retention:**  
    - The image URL and response data (dominantColors) are used only to enrich the current session.  
    - No images or results are stored beyond the runtime of the API call.  

- **objectRecognitionAPI Endpoint**  
  - **Data Received:**  
    - `image_url` (public URL)  
  - **Purpose:** Identify objects, detect a dominant background color, and determine a subject type (`human`, `product`, `graphic`, or `other`) for the banner-ad image.  
  - **Retention:**  
    - The image URL and response data (objects array, dominant_color, subject_type) are used only to enrich the current session.  
    - No images or results are stored beyond the API call’s execution.

## 3. Third-Party Services  
- Both `colorDetectionAPI` and `objectRecognitionAPI` are provided by RapidAPI‐hosted services:  
  - **Dominant Color in an Image** (`dominant-color-in-an-image.p.rapidapi.com`)  
  - **Regim Object Recognition** (`regim3.p.rapidapi.com`)  
- We do not store or share any user-provided image URLs or API responses outside of this session.  
- RapidAPI may collect anonymous usage metrics, but individual image URLs or results are not logged or shared by RapidAPI beyond their own transient processing.

## 4. Data Security  
- All API calls occur over HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) to both RapidAPI endpoints.  
- The user’s RapidAPI key (X-RapidAPI-Key) is transmitted securely in the request header and is never logged or stored in plaintext.  
- No personally identifiable information (PII) or campaign-specific data outside of the provided image URLs and metrics is collected.  
- Transient logs (timestamp, endpoint called) may be stored for no more than 24 hours for debugging, then purged.

## 5. Sharing & Disclosure  
- We do not share any user-provided image URLs, response data, or campaign metrics with third parties, except to the extent necessary to perform the API call (i.e., sending the image URL to the RapidAPI service).  
- Aggregated, anonymized usage statistics (e.g., number of calls per day) may be shared internally to improve reliability.

## 6. User Rights  
- **Request Deletion:** Because no persistent storage of results exists, there is no data to delete. Any transient logs are automatically purged within 24 hours.  
- **Data Access:** No personal data is retained beyond the API call execution, so there is no data to access.

## 7. Changes to This Policy  
We may update this policy if RapidAPI or our processing methods change. We will post any changes at the top of this document with an updated “Last Updated” date.
