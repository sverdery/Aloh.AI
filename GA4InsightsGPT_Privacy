Privacy Policy for GA4 Insights GPT
Effective Date: 04/26/2025

1. Overview
GA4 Insights GPT is designed to help users interactively access and analyze their own Google Analytics 4 (GA4) data. We prioritize user privacy, data security, and transparency. This policy explains how your data is handled.

2. Data Access and Usage
GA4 Insights GPT requires a user-supplied access token to fetch GA4 data.

The access token is used only within your active session to retrieve your authorized GA4 reports.

No personal information, access tokens, or analytics data is stored, saved, or transmitted outside of the session.

After fetching the requested analytics reports, all data remains transient and is not retained after the session ends.

3. User Control
You are in full control of your access token at all times.

You may wipe your token from memory at any point during the session by typing "WIPE TOKEN."

GA4 Insights GPT will automatically mask part of your access token when displaying it to enhance your security.

4. No Data Sharing
We do not share, sell, or distribute any information you provide.

We do not store any GA4 account details, access tokens, or analytics data on external servers.

5. Third-Party Services
GA4 Insights GPT connects directly to Google's Analytics Data API using your provided access token.

All data remains within the secure systems governed by OpenAIâ€™s platform during your active session.

6. Security Disclaimer
While we take reasonable measures to protect your data during your session, users are responsible for keeping their access tokens secure. Never share your token with others.

7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updated versions will be communicated clearly within the GPT experience or linked documentation.
