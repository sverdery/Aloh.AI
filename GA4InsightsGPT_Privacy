Privacy Policy for GA4 Insights GPT
Effective Date: 04/29/2025

1. Overview
GA4 Insights GPT is an AI assistant designed to help users analyze their website performance using Google Analytics 4 (GA4) data. This privacy policy outlines how we handle your data during your interaction with this GPT.

2. Data Access and Usage
The assistant only accesses data you provide directly in the session — either by:

Pasting a temporary GA4 access token

Uploading a report (CSV, PDF)

Pasting a screenshot of a GA4 dashboard

The GA4 access token is used solely to retrieve your analytics data during the active session.

All data retrieval is performed through the Google Analytics Data API using your provided token.

3. Data Retention and Storage
No data is stored after your session ends.

Access tokens, report data, and analytics insights are processed in real-time only and are never saved to any database or external server.

Your access token is stored in memory only during the session and can be erased at any time using the WIPE TOKEN command.

4. Security Practices
All data is transmitted securely via HTTPS to Google’s official API endpoints.

The assistant does not store, log, or transmit your access token or analytics data outside of OpenAI's environment.

You are responsible for keeping your access token confidential. Never share it with others outside this assistant.

5. User Control
You are in full control of your data at all times:

You can choose to use manual report uploads or screenshots if you prefer not to connect via token.

You may type WIPE TOKEN at any time to erase your token from memory.

6. Third-Party Services
This assistant connects to Google Analytics Data API (https://analyticsdata.googleapis.com) to retrieve analytics data using your access token.

No data is sent to any other third-party service.

7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy in the future to reflect changes in functionality or compliance needs. Any updates will be made clear within the GPT description or onboarding flow.
